# Jarvis-Voice-Assistant

Jarvis Voice Assistant is a Python-based virtual assistant that integrates OpenAI for intelligent responses. It uses speech_recognition for voice input, pyttsx3 for speech output, and requests for fetching real-time news. The assistant can open websites, fetch and read news headlines, and play music from a custom libraryâ€”all through voice commands. Additionally, it supports a graceful shutdown command with a spoken exit message.
